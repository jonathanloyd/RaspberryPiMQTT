# RaspberryPiMQTT

Installed Raspberry Pi OS Lite to the Raspberry Pi. 
Enabled WiFi and SSH using raspi-config. 
Installed mosquitto MQTT broker and tested to ensure it is working locally. 
Tested localhost with mosquitto MQTT broker to ensure localhost is receiving the MQTT messages it sends.

TODO NEXT:
continue writing python script to ensure it can send and receive MQTT messages to and from esp8266
test TLS/SSL on MQTT transmission to ensure security
